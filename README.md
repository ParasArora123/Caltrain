# Caltrain Mobile App

The folks at Caltrain SF made me upset when they overcharged me and wouldn't refund me! As a result, I created this app that mimics their current app in which you can buy tickets with 
valid QR codes at no cost.

This is a react native app (that uses expo) that will work on android, IOS, and web. On the first screen, you will be prompted to enter the time in which you 'purchased' the ticket. Then it will take you to a screen which mimics the official Caltrain application that can (but for legal reasons should not be) shown to official Caltrain employees.

**This app was made for learning purposes ONLY, use at your own risk.**
